					<h3>Abstract</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						Mass production and population growth have produced an increase in the generation of municipal
						solid waste (MSW) in urban settlements. In consequence, efficient treatment of waste has become
						a challenge for cleaning entities, possibly because they continue performing collecting
						operations using fixed periodic routes that exhaustively go across neighbourhood streets in
						search of every dumpster. Furthermore, in these operations recyclable material is not separated
						from disposable one, at least in Bogota, thus causing a negative impact on the environment. This
						work aims to prototype a sensing system that generates routes based on the actual fulfilment
						level reported by dumpsters. For this purpose, dumpsters were equipped with a level measurement
						device that uses a proximity ultrasonic sensor. Information was transmitted using a LPWAN
						(LoRa), and collected data were used to determine which of the dumpsters needs to be collected
						in the route planned for a specific date, according to the levels reported. Since an operation
						requires many collecting trucks, a K-means method is used to group dumpsters that are
						geographically close. A single district of Bogota was selected for demonstration purposes. The
						collecting sequence was calculated using an open Web service, whose results are shown on an
						Android mobile application. The mobile app uses the Google Maps routing service. The system
						shows important reduction of saturation and overflow of containers.

							<h3>Conclusions</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Municipal solid waste (MSW) has been increasing in recent years, impacting public health,
							lifestyles, and the environment. To address this, city governments have made efforts to
							manage waste sustainably. This research proposes an efficient sensing system that enables
							cities to make data-driven decisions for waste collection. A prototype was implemented using
							LoRa technology to transmit data from dumpsters to a GIS database, allowing the generation
							of optimized collection routes. These routes prioritize dumpsters with high fill levels,
							reducing travel time and increasing efficiency, with routes displayed in a mobile app to
							assist truck drivers.
						</p>
						<p>
							The system addresses the issue of outdated information that hinders dynamic route planning
							for MSW collection. By integrating IoT and GIS technologies across different
							layers—physical, networking, data processing, and application—it provides benefits such as
							cleaner streets, better waste classification, and support for a circular economy. The
							research highlights the importance of updated data in improving operations and demonstrates
							the feasibility of using IoT-enabled sensing systems for waste management. For real-world
							deployment, considerations include sensor accuracy, energy management, node density, and
							terrain characteristics for more precise route planning.
