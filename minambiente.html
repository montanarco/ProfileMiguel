								<h2>Shared Components, System design and Architecture</h2>
								<p>Full-stack developer and Architect</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								I served as the architect for three key projects, including the primary system of the
								entity, which allows enterprises to submit requests for performing industrial and
								economic activities using the country's natural resources, while also tracking the
								status of these requests.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another major project, CIMA, involved developing a system to collect data from various
								environmental sources, such as temperature and rainfall changes, deforestation, river
								and water dam levels, fires, and air pollution. This data was streamed through topics,
								processed by data models, and displayed on dashboards for analysis.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, I contributed to projects that enabled interoperation and data exchange
								with other governmental partners. These included systems that handled citizen
								information and exposed environmental data to regional entities.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a developer, I integrated information from a tool called the geo-visor, which
								displays environmental data on themes such as deforestation, weather patterns in
								mountainous areas, and water resources over time. I connected this data to Power BI
								dashboards for better visualization and decision-making.
							</p>
							<p>
								Furthermore, I facilitated the integration of the governmental single sign-on (SSO)
								system into several Ministry of Environment systems, allowing users to access services
								without the need for new credentials. I also diagnosed legacy applications and developed
								a migration plan to transition them to a modern technology stack, making the systems
								easier to maintain and evolve.

									<h3>Carrer Growth</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									This experience significantly contributed to my professional growth, particularly in
									system architecture and integration. As the lead architect for key projects, I
									gained deep expertise in designing systems that handle large-scale data, such as
									CIMA, which processes environmental data streams for analysis and decision-making.
									My work on enterprise request tracking systems strengthened my ability to create
									scalable and efficient platforms. I also enhanced my skills in data interoperability
									by facilitating the exchange of information between governmental entities, which
									sharpened my understanding of how to integrate complex systems across organizations
								</p>
								<p>
									Moreover, I expanded my technical repertoire by working on data visualization tools
									like the geo-visor and integrating them with business intelligence platforms such as
									Power BI. This role also provided valuable experience in legacy system
									modernization, where I helped diagnose and migrate outdated systems to modern
									technology stacks, improving their maintainability and scalability. Additionally,
									integrating single sign-on (SSO) solutions with the Ministry of Environment’s
									systems deepened my knowledge of user authentication and security best practices,
									positioning me as a more versatile developer and architect.
