								<p>Software Engineer </p>
							</header>
							<p>
								I was part of the Expedia Cars Rental Team, where I contributed to developing and
								maintaining features that support the car rental web page. My responsibilities included
								gathering and organizing information from various providers, such as available cars,
								pick-up and drop-off locations, vendor schedules, rental policies, additional equipment,
								and pricing. I ensured this data was structured to meet Expedia’s user interface
								requirements. I also worked on business operations software, this ways clients can book,
								modify, or cancel reservations, manage payments, and receive notifications.
							</p>
							<p>
								Expedia’s development environment was highly automated. We followed strict quality
								standards, including thorough testing and code reviews. Every code change was checked,
								built, and tested automatically. The system created documentation and stored backup
								versions, making it easy to roll back if needed. Deployments to different environments
								were managed through automated pipelines, and we monitored services to ensure
								reliability.

									<h3>Career Growth</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									During my year at Expedia, I helped create new services and features, improved
									application security, and modernized the user interface for one application. I also
									worked on making legacy code easier to maintain and supported solution design.
									Although my role was mostly operational, I learned new technologies and processes,
									such as Kotlin, automated deployment tools, and advanced debugging. I collaborated
									with engineers from different regions and specialties, which expanded my teamwork
									skills and broadened my perspective on software development.
