											<h2>Forms and Architecture</h2>
											<p>Full-stack developer and Architect</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											I successfully led the development and delivery of key backend features, including a robust API for secure 
											document storage and retrieval, ensuring that only authorized users could access their documents. Additionally, 
											I enhanced the system's logging capabilities and integrated an online payment solution, allowing seamless transactions. 
											I also built a tracking service to process payments made at physical bank offices, ensuring accurate updates to user accounts.
										</p>
										<p>
											On the frontend, I played a crucial role in creating user-friendly digital tax forms for the citizens of Colombia, 
											enabling them to report taxes, electronically sign documents, and make payments. I contributed to the development 
											of major forms, such as #110 (Enterprise Income), #210 (General People Income), #350 (Consumption in Bars and Restaurants), 
											#420 (Patrimony), #430 (Fuel), and #435 (Carbon). These efforts helped streamline the digital tax reporting process 
											and were accomplished using Angular for the frontend and Java for backend services.

												<h3>Carrer Growth</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This experience significantly broadened my understanding of the software development lifecycle, particularly in 
												the importance of creating well-structured abstractions and ensuring low coupling to build modular, reusable components. 
												I also gained valuable insights into addressing critical security vulnerabilities, such as DNS spoofing, 
												cross-site scripting, and phishing attacks, enhancing the protection of user data and safeguarding against potential scams.
											</p>
											<p>
												During my time there, I received training that sharpened my frontend development skills, which I applied to deliver real-world solutions. 
												This hands-on experience allowed me to grow as a full-stack developer, integrating both backend and frontend technologies to build secure, 
												scalable applications.
