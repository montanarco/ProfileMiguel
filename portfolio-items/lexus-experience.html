								<h3>Full-Stack Developer and platform Manager</h2>
								<p>I worked for two vehicle producers:</p>
								<h3>1. Automation and Traffic Monitoring for Platform Optimization</h3>
							</header>
							<ul>
								<li> <strong> Task Automation:</strong> Automated content caching, eliminating the need
									for manual updates after each production release, which occurred twice a month.
								</li>
								<li> <strong> Traffic Monitoring: </strong> Monitored and analyzed web traffic to track
									user visits and product clicks, providing valuable insights during marketing
									campaigns. </li>
								<li> <strong> Request Management: </strong> Streamlined the organization and processing
									of local dealersâ€™ requests, integrating them directly into the platform for more
									efficient handling and analysis. </li>

							</ul>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>2. AWS Infrastructure Management and Front-End Development</h3>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li> <strong> AWS Services:</strong> Maintained and enhanced AWS Lambda functions
										connected to databases and services to shape and provide data for various
										applications. Configured AWS services such as Route 53, API Gateway, and
										Cognito. </li>
									<li> <strong> Component Development: </strong> Developed components for a CMS to
										manage input information and built services that returned the content to web
										pages. </li>
									<li> <strong> Frontend Solutions: </strong> Implemented front-end components to
										display data, particularly in the offers section. This included dynamic pricing
										for specific user groups (college students, military members, government
										employees) and technical detail comparisons between product models.
										Additionally, contributed to building a digital counter for tracking spare parts
										and accessories. </li>

								</ul>

									<h3>Carrer Growth</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									These experiences have significantly contributed to my growth as a software engineer
									by enhancing my ability to automate, optimize, and scale complex systems. The
									automation of content caching and the analysis of traffic patterns honed my skills
									in identifying and addressing inefficiencies, improving the overall performance of
									the platforms I worked on. By managing local dealers' requests and integrating them
									into a central platform, I learned how to streamline workflows and effectively
									organize large amounts of data, which has proven invaluable in optimizing backend
									processes. These experiences strengthened my problem-solving abilities and deepened
									my understanding of how different system components interact to achieve seamless
									performance.
								</p>
								<p>
									Additionally, working with AWS services such as Lambda, Route 53, API Gateway, and
									Cognito helped me refine my cloud infrastructure and serverless architecture
									expertise. Building and maintaining CMS components, as well as front-end solutions
									for displaying key data, gave me the opportunity to bridge the gap between back-end
									processes and user-facing applications. This well-rounded experience has made me
									more adaptable and capable of handling diverse challenges, from database management
									to frontend development, ultimately making me a more effective and resourceful
									software engineer.
