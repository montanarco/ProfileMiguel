								<h2>IoT Systems Researcher and Architect</h2>
								<p>I was part of the Research Laboratory for Intelligent Systems (LISI)</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								I contributed to several projects, including face detection for human identification,
								satellite image processing for detecting mono-farming activities, and leading a smart
								waste management system. The waste management project involved measuring garbage levels
								in street dumpsters and transmitting that data via the LoRa communication protocol to a
								gateway. Using this information, along with the availability of collection trucks, we
								dynamically calculated optimized routes that balanced load and reduced travel time.
								These routes, displayed through the Google Maps API on a mobile app, improved waste
								collection efficiency, prioritizing areas like industrial and residential zones to
								prevent dumpster overflow and contamination.
							</p>
							<p>
								I was responsible for defining system properties, testing sensors and devices that
								accurately measured waste levels and ensured long-lasting energy autonomy. I configured
								the LoRa network for packet transmission and set up the gateway using a star topology to
								receive and process messages. These messages triggered web services that formatted and
								stored the data for route calculation. The algorithm used k-means clustering and
								mathematical models to group dumpsters by available trucks, and OpenRouteService
								generated the routes, which I integrated into a mobile app for real-time collection
								guidance.

									<h3>Carrer Growth</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Leading these projects, especially the intelligent waste management system,
									significantly enhanced my problem-solving and leadership skills. I gained hands-on
									experience in IoT, data streaming, and algorithm development, which strengthened my
									ability to design and implement scalable systems. Working with technologies IoT data
									transmission, Maps API, and clustering, and classification models, further deepened
									my understanding of complex system integration, optimization, and real-time data
									processing, making me a more well-rounded software engineer.
								</p>
								<p>
									This experience is highly transferable to other industries, such as logistics,
									agriculture, and urban planning, where optimizing routes, resource allocation, and
									real-time data analysis are critical. The skills I developed in managing sensor
									networks, configuring communication protocols, and automating processes can be
									applied to improve efficiency and reduce costs in sectors like supply chain
									management, smart cities, and environmental monitoring.
